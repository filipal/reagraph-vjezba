          To provide you with the most accurate and personalized virtual try-on experience, our solution creates a realistic 3D avatar based on your body profile. This avatar helps simulate how clothing will look and fit on your unique physique. To achieve this, we use a combination of manual input and advanced machine learning techniques based on the following personal data:
        </p>
        <div className={styles.sectionTitle}>Personal Data We Use</div>
        <ul className={styles.dataList}>
          <li><b>Age Range</b>: Your age range helps us estimate typical body composition associated with your life stage. This ensures your avatar reflects realistic proportions and characteristics.</li>
          <li><b>Height</b>: Establishes the overall scale of your avatar and provides proportional accuracy across limbs and torso.</li>
          <li><b>Weight</b>: Used alongside height to determine overall body mass and shape, which impacts clothing fit and avatar realism.</li>
          <li><b>Body Shape</b>: Helps us model the overall silhouette and balance of your avatarâ€™s torso, hips, and shoulders.</li>
          <li><b>Fitness Level</b>: Provides insight into muscle tone, body composition, contributing to a more lifelike and personalized avatar.</li>
          <li><b>Main Measurements (Chest, Waist, Hips)</b>: Key for defining torso proportions and ensuring a precise digital fit.</li>
          <li><b>Body Photos</b>: Front and side photos of your body are used by our machine learning models to extract precise body measurements. This enables us to automatically and accurately replicate your real-world shape in 3D.</li>
          <li><b>Face Photos</b>: Front and side photos of your face allows us to generate a realistic facial likeness for your avatar. This step is optional but enhances the personalization of your digital twin.</li>
        </ul>
        <div className={styles.sectionTitle}>Why We Collect This Information</div>
        <p>
          All of this data is used solely to create a more precise and realistic digital twin avatar. This allows the app to:
