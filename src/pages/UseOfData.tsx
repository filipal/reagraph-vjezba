          To provide you with the most accurate and personalized virtual try-on experience, our solution creates a realistic 3D avatar based on your body profile. <br />This avatar helps simulate how clothing will look and fit on your unique physique.
        </span>
        <p>
          To achieve this, we use a combination of manual input and advanced machine learning techniques based on the following personal data:
        </p>
        <ol className={styles.dataList}>
          <li><b>1. Age Range</b>
          Your age range helps us estimate typical body composition associated with your life stage. This ensures your avatar reflects realistic proportions and characteristics.
          </li>
          <li><b>2. Height</b>
          Establishes the overall scale of your avatar and provides proportional accuracy across limbs and torso.
          </li>
          <li><b>3. Weight</b>
          Used alongside height to determine overall body mass and shape, which impacts clothing fit and avatar realism.</li>
          <li><b>4. Body Shape</b>
          Helps us model the overall silhouette and balance of your avatarâ€™s torso, hips, and shoulders.</li>
          <li><b>5. Fitness Level</b>
          Provides insight into muscle tone, body composition, contributing to a more lifelike and personalized avatar.</li>
          <li><b>6. Main Measurements (Chest, Waist, Hips)</b>
          Key for defining torso proportions and ensuring a precise digital fit.</li>
          <li><b>7. Body Photos</b>
          Front and side photos of your body are used by our machine learning models to extract precise body measurements. This enables us to automatically and accurately replicate your real-world shape in 3D.</li>
          <li><b>8. Face Photos</b>
          Front and side photos of your face allows us to generate a realistic facial likeness for your avatar. This step is optional but enhances the personalization of your digital twin.</li>
