# FitSpace Frontend

This repository contains the React + TypeScript source for the FitSpace demo application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The app provides a simple login page that routes to an avatar management screen.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

The dev server runs on Vite's default port, usually `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Build for production

```

The compiled output is placed in the `dist` directory.

### Lint the project

npm run lint
```

Running this command checks the project with ESLint.
